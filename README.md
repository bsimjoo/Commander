# Commander
Multiple computers controling by TCP/IP server and clients.

### Who may need this software?
For example, if you're administrator of so many computers, you'll need to run a command on all of them and this process would take too much time because you must run the same command on each computer one by one. With Commander, you just need to install the client software on your computers and run server on administrator computer. Then enter command on server and your clients will execute it.
